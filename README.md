<h1>My name is Josh Deckard!</h1>

I am currently in college studying for my AA in Software Development geared toward Full Stack Development. I have a passion for FrontEnd Development with React, and Laravel. With over 2 years of programming experience, I am continuously expanding my knowledge and skills. I welcome any feedback and am always eager to take on new challenges.

My expertise lies in Full Stack Development, and have had the opportunity to work various languages and frameworks such as <strong>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, NodeJS, Kotlin, PHP, Laravel.</strong> I am proficient in utilizing DBMS services such as <strong>MySql, SQLite, MongoDB.</strong>

It would be a privilege to have the chance to work and collaborate with you! Feel free to reach out!
